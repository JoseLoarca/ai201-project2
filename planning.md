## Tools

List every tool your agent will use. For each tool, fill in all four fields.
You must have at least 3 tools. The three required tools are listed — add any additional tools below them.

### Tool 1: search_listings

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `description` (str): ...
- `size` (str): ...
- `max_price` (float): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value — what fields does a result contain? -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if no listings match? -->

---

### Tool 2: suggest_outfit

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `new_item` (dict): ...
- `wardrobe` (dict): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the wardrobe is empty or no outfit can be suggested? -->

---

### Tool 3: create_fit_card

**What it does:**
<!-- Describe what this tool does in 1–2 sentences -->

**Input parameters:**
<!-- List each parameter, its type, and what it represents -->
- `outfit` (...): ...

**What it returns:**
<!-- Describe the return value -->

**What happens if it fails or returns nothing:**
<!-- What should the agent do if the outfit data is incomplete? -->

---

### Additional Tools (if any)

<!-- Copy the block above for any tools beyond the required three -->

---

## Planning Loop

**How does your agent decide which tool to call next?**
<!-- Describe the logic your planning loop uses. What does it look at? What conditions change its behavior? How does it know when it's done? -->

---

## State Management

**How does information from one tool get passed to the next?**
<!-- Describe how your agent stores and accesses state within a session. What data is tracked? How is it passed between tool calls? -->

---

## Error Handling

For each tool, describe the specific failure mode you're handling and what the agent does in response.

| Tool | Failure mode | Agent response |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| search_listings | No results match the query | |
| suggest_outfit | Wardrobe is empty | |
| create_fit_card | Outfit input is missing or incomplete | |

---

## Architecture

<!-- Draw a diagram of your agent showing how the components connect:
     User input → Planning Loop → Tools (search_listings, suggest_outfit, create_fit_card)
                                                                          ↕
                                                                   State / Session
     Show what triggers each tool, how state flows between them, and where error paths branch off.
     ASCII art, a Mermaid diagram (https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), or an embedded
     sketch are all fine. You'll share this diagram with an AI tool when asking it to implement
     the planning loop and each individual tool. -->

---

## AI Tool Plan

<!-- For each part of the implementation below, describe:
     - Which AI tool you plan to use (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
     - What you'll give it as input (which sections of this planning.md, your agent diagram)
     - What you expect it to produce
     - How you'll verify the output matches your spec before moving on

     "I'll use AI to help me code" is not a plan.
     "I'll give Claude my Tool 1 spec (inputs, return value, failure mode) and ask it to implement
     search_listings() using load_listings() from the data loader — then test it against 3 queries
     before trusting it" is a plan. -->

**Milestone 3 — Individual tool implementations:**

**Milestone 4 — Planning loop and state management:**

## A Complete Interaction (Step by Step)

Write out what a full user interaction looks like from start to finish — tool call by tool call. Use a specific example query.

**Example user query:** "I'm looking for a vintage graphic tee under $30. I mostly wear baggy jeans and chunky sneakers. What's out there and how would I style it?"

**Step 1:** <!-- What does the agent do first? Which tool is called? With what input? -->
The agent starts by searching (using the search_listings() tool) for listings that match the criteria specified by the 
user: vintage graphic tee under $30.

This is an example of how the tool call would look: 
```python
search_listings("vintage graphic tee", max_price=30.0)
```

**Step 2:** <!-- What happens next? What was returned from step 1? What tool is called now? -->
The tool call from Step 1 returns the following listings:
```json
[
    {
        "id": "lst_002",
        "title": "Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print",
        "description": "Super cute early 2000s baby tee with butterfly graphic. Fitted crop length. Tag says medium but fits like a small.",
        "category": "tops",
        "style_tags": ["y2k", "vintage", "graphic tee", "cottagecore"],
        "size": "S/M",
        "condition": "excellent",
        "price": 18,
        "colors": ["white", "pink", "purple"],
        "brand": null,
        "platform": "depop"
    },
    {
        "id": "lst_006",
        "title": "Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style",
        "description": "Vintage-style bootleg tee with faded graphic. Slightly boxy fit. 100% cotton, soft and worn-in.",
        "category": "tops",
        "style_tags": ["graphic tee", "vintage", "grunge", "streetwear", "band tee"],
        "size": "L",
        "condition": "good",
        "price": 24,
        "colors": ["black"],
        "brand": null,
        "platform": "depop"
    },
    {
        "id": "lst_033",
        "title": "Vintage Band Tee — Faded Grey",
        "description": "Faded grey band-style tee with distressed graphic. Crew neck. Fits boxy. Well-loved but no holes or major damage.",
        "category": "tops",
        "style_tags": ["vintage", "grunge", "band tee", "graphic tee", "streetwear"],
        "size": "L",
        "condition": "fair",
        "price": 19,
        "colors": ["grey", "charcoal"],
        "brand": null,
        "platform": "depop"
    }
]

```
The results are ordered by relevance: condition is a top priority, followed by price. Based on this,
the agent picks the first listing:
```json
{
    "id": "lst_002",
    "title": "Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print",
    "description": "Super cute early 2000s baby tee with butterfly graphic. Fitted crop length. Tag says medium but fits like a small.",
    "category": "tops",
    "style_tags": ["y2k", "vintage", "graphic tee", "cottagecore"],
    "size": "S/M",
    "condition": "excellent",
    "price": 18,
    "colors": ["white", "pink", "purple"],
    "brand": null,
    "platform": "depop"
}
```
Now, the agent uses this listing and the user's wardrobe (baggy jeans and chunky sneakers) to call suggest_outfit().
This is an example of how the tool call would look:
```python
item = {
    "id": "lst_002",
    "title": "Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print",
    "description": "Super cute early 2000s baby tee with butterfly graphic. Fitted crop length. Tag says medium but fits like a small.",
    "category": "tops",
    "style_tags": ["y2k", "vintage", "graphic tee", "cottagecore"],
    "size": "S/M",
    "condition": "excellent",
    "price": 18,
    "colors": ["white", "pink", "purple"],
    "brand": None,
    "platform": "depop",
}


wardrobe = {
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "w_001",
            "name": "Baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash",
            "category": "bottoms",
            "colors": ["dark blue", "indigo"],
            "style_tags": ["denim", "streetwear", "baggy"],
            "notes": "High-waisted, sits above the hip",
        },
        {
            "id": "w_007",
            "name": "Chunky white sneakers",
            "category": "shoes",
            "colors": ["white"],
            "style_tags": ["sneakers", "chunky", "streetwear"],
            "notes": None,
        },
    ]
}


suggest_outfit(item, wardrobe)
```

**Step 3:** <!-- Continue until the full interaction is complete -->
The tool call from Step 2 returns the following: "_Pair this with your wide-leg jeans and platform Docs for a classic 90s grunge look. Roll the sleeves once and tuck the front corner slightly for shape._"

Now, the agent goes ahead and performs a call to create_fit_card() to get the final output for the user.

This is an example of how the tool call would look:
```python
outfit = "Pair this with your wide-leg jeans and platform Docs for a classic 90s grunge look. Roll the sleeves once and tuck the front corner slightly for shape."

item = {
    "id": "lst_002",
    "title": "Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print",
    "description": "Super cute early 2000s baby tee with butterfly graphic. Fitted crop length. Tag says medium but fits like a small.",
    "category": "tops",
    "style_tags": ["y2k", "vintage", "graphic tee", "cottagecore"],
    "size": "S/M",
    "condition": "excellent",
    "price": 18,
    "colors": ["white", "pink", "purple"],
    "brand": None,
    "platform": "depop",
}

create_fit_card(outfit, item)
```

**Final output to user:** <!-- What does the user actually see at the end? -->
The tool call from Step 3 returns the following: "_thrifted this faded band tee off depop for $22 and honestly it was made for my wide-legs 🖤 full look in my stories_".

This is the final output that the user sees at the end.
